      <p>
        I am an experienced professional with 12 years of experience in various industries, from Financial Services to Education and from big multinational companies to startups. I have taken leadership roles in Finance working as a Finance Manager, Corporate Finance Manager and Head of Finance. I am currently a Product Manager for an EdTech company based in Cambridge, MA.
        <br><br>
        I consider myself a lifelong learner as I am always seeking new topics to study and master. I try to balance my self-pace studying with formal education.
        <br><br>
        My areas of interest are technology, analytics, product management, finance, investments, and capital markets and 
        my goal is to be the most dynamic professional as I can. 
        <br><br>
        Today I can bring to the table skills in finance, M&A, accounting, FP&A, product management, data analytics, data modeling, strategy, and programming.
        I have developed coding and technology skills on a coding boot camp, on my Masterâ€™s in Science degree in Business Analytics and at work. My tech stack comprises: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Python, R, SQL and PostgreSQL. I have also tried Hadoop, Spark and MongoDB.
