      <p>
        My name is Vinicius Ishizaki. I have 13 years of experience launching and developing technology products and holding leadership roles in Finance, from Financial Services to Education and from big multinational companies to startups. I am currently a Product Manager for an EdTech company based in Cambridge, MA and working remote from San Francisco, CA.
        <br><br>
        As a Product Manager for an EdTech startup I have worked on features that impacted over 400k students, who wrote more than 90 million words in our app and we have reached out more than 100 countries. 
        <br>
        As Toshibaâ€™s Head of Finance, I led the implementation project of a new ERP system, transitioning from SAP to Oracle impacting 250MM worth of assets.
        <br><br>
        I consider myself a lifelong learner as I am always seeking new topics to study and master. I try to balance my self-pace studying with formal education. My areas of interest are AI/ML, analytics, product management, finance, investments, and capital markets and my goal is to be the most dynamic professional as I can.

        <br><br>
        Today I can bring to the table skills in finance, M&A, accounting, FP&A, product management, data analytics, data modeling, strategy, and programming. My tech stack comprises: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Python, R, SQL and PostgreSQL. I have also tried Hadoop, Spark and MongoDB.
